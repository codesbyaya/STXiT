# STXiT 🧹

*Decentralized Community-Powered Account Cleanup*

## Overview

**STXiT** is a decentralized platform that empowers users to identify and close inactive or unwanted accounts on centralized platforms—such as social media networks, online gaming services, or subscription-based tools—through a transparent, community-driven voting mechanism.

By harnessing the power of blockchain and collective decision-making, STXiT provides a reliable, fair, and ethical system for account deactivation and digital footprint management.

## 🔍 Problem

Online services accumulate countless abandoned or inactive accounts, which:

* Create unnecessary server load.
* Pose security risks.
* Skew user analytics.
* Violate user privacy if forgotten data is mishandled.

Many users don’t know how to delete these accounts or simply forget about them.

---

## 💡 Solution

STXiT enables a **community-led initiative** to:

* **Identify** inactive or unwanted accounts across centralized platforms.
* **Vote** on whether accounts meet criteria for closure.
* **Execute** account shutdown requests (with or without user authentication, depending on the platform's openness).

All actions are recorded on a blockchain to ensure transparency, immutability, and consensus.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Decentralized Voting System**: Use tokens to participate in proposals and account closure votes.
* 🔒 **Privacy-First Protocols**: Users can report accounts anonymously; no personal data is stored on-chain.
* 📜 **Auditable Smart Contracts**: Every decision is verifiable and recorded on a public ledger.
* 🔗 **Multi-Platform Support**: Interfaces with APIs of supported centralized services.
* 🧠 **Community Moderation**: Stakeholders and token holders help define account inactivity rules.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Blockchain**: Ethereum / Polygon / other EVM-compatible chains.
* **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based governance and voting logic.
* **Frontend**: React, Web3.js or Ethers.js.
* **Backend**: Node.js, IPFS for metadata storage.
* **Authentication**: Wallet-based (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
